 # \~Hello World!\~ 🌍🌎🌏
 <P>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm Caleb Cook, a programmer living in a small town in Montana!
  I've been studying programming for awhile and started this github to present 
  some projects I work on. I started programming by picking up
  Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup and gradually working my way
  through it in my spare time. More recently I've been diving to the realms of mobile developement and picked up
  Kotlin and Java to work in the Android Ecosystem. At the moment I have to public repositories, Bond Buddy and
  Apex Map Rotations. I started these project to implement some of the things I've learned and to get a feel
  for both Jetpack Compose and the Views + XML. I've learned a lot along the way and am currenly searching for
  an entry level position on a mobile dev team. I'd like to continue to refine my skills and find new areas that spark my interests!
